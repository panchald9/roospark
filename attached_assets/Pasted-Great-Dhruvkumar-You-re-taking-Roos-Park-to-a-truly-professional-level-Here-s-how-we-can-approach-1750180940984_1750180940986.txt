Great, Dhruvkumar! You're taking Roos Park to a truly professional level. Here's how we can approach the next phase of upgrades:

✅ PHASE 2: Feature Expansion Plan
1. 🔴 Live Order / Pickup System
Frontend: Add "Order Now" button on menu items.

Order Flow:

Choose item(s) → Pickup or Delivery → Contact Info

Backend:

Save order details in the database

Send confirmation email or display summary

2. 🔐 User Login for Reservations
User registration & login (Flask + SQLite/MySQL)

Password encryption (using bcrypt)

Table bookings tied to user accounts

Users can edit/cancel bookings

3. 📊 Admin Dashboard Stats
Add to admin panel:

Total Menu Items: Menu.query.count()

Total Reservations: Reservation.query.count()

Most Viewed Category: Track clicks using JavaScript and update stats in DB

4. 🌐 SEO & Meta Tags
Each page should include:

html
Copy
Edit
<title>Roos Park – Fine Dining in Ahmedabad</title>
<meta name="description" content="Discover Indian, Chinese, Italian and more at Roos Park. Reserve a table or order online.">
<meta property="og:image" content="/static/images/og-banner.jpg">
<meta property="og:title" content="Roos Park Restaurant">
<meta property="og:description" content="The ultimate multi-cuisine experience. Book your table now.">
5. ♿ Accessibility Improvements
alt="Chicken Biryani" on all images

Use tabindex and ARIA roles for keyboard users

Ensure color contrast: e.g., white text on dark backgrounds
